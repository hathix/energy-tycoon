Tutorial
========

Let”s get started! You are about to embark on a project to create an alternative energy empire in America, the unknown land of alternative energy.

Click on a city to add a new plant. I’d recommend to not expand to a city right now because you will use one-fourth of your total money.  

At first, you can only add a solar farm. This will cost $25,000, so make sure you get a good profit from that solar farm before building any more.

You seem to be have quite a lot of money now (over 200,000). Try expanding into other cities, and do research (click on the research tab on the homepage) on other sorts of alternative energy. Your profit each year will increase by at least fivefold.
