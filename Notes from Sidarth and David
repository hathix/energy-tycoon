1. add the loan feature (plus the credit score idea, if your credit score falls too low because you can't pay debt in time, then it falls, everyone starts off with a credit score of 100%)
2. add more regions in the northwest (like salt lake city, utah)
3. (in the future), create a world tycoon, expanding to every continent of the world! 
4. (in the future), possibly build a tycoon on the Moon (let's ignore the expensive transportation costs), and siphon off gas from other planets in our solar system.
5. Restrict the regions so that you can only see the unlocked one. (This adds more depth to the game).
6. add natural disasters (based on a certain probability)
